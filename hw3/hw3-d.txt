Comment on your experience using a cloud-hosted DBMS.  Would you recommend it to a fellow student for tinkering/experimentation?  What about recommending it to future co-workers for their project?  If your answer differed, why?

I would recommend using cloud-hosted DBMS since it is convenient that we are not necessary to download all data. We can simply use a link to store our data and connect to the database. Also, it quickly to generate output as well. However, I would not highly recommend it. Because it needs reconnect frequently and as you fresh the page, the code and results would lost, which means we need to store our result in time. I would say it is a great idea to share your sql code by using DBMS in project, but I will emphasize the importance to store and save the .sql file timely.
